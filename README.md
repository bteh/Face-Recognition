## About

Face Recognition is made in React in the front-end and Node.js in the back-end. Feel free to register and sign in as it saves the login information in PostgresSQL. Once logged in, choose any picture of your choice and paste it onto the application! Now watch as it detects the face of the picture through Clarifai-API.
